- **Undo/Redo System**: State snapshot management with action history tracking

### **Shape Data Format**
Each shape is stored as an object with type-specific properties including universal tag and visibility:
```javascript
// Ellipse/Rectangle (with tag and visibility)
{id: 1, type: "ellipse", x: 50, y: 50, w: 100, h: 100, f1: "#000000", f2: "#ff0000", s: "1", tag: "myEllipse", visible: true}

// Line (with tag and visibility)
{id: 2, type: "line", x1: 50, y1: 50, x2: 150, y2: 150, f: "#000000", s: "1", tag: "myLine", visible: true}

// V_Separator (with tag and visibility)
{id: 3, type: "v_separator", x: 300, w: 2, color: "#000000", pen: "1", tag: "vSep1", visible: true}

// H_Separator (with tag and visibility)
{id: 4, type: "h_separator", y: 200, h: 2, color: "#000000", pen: "1", tag: "hSep1", visible: true}
```

### **Export Text Format**
Shapes are exported in standardized text format:
```
ELLIPSE(50,50,100,100,"#000000","#ff0000",1,"myEllipse",1)
RECT(50,50,100,100,"#000000","#ff0000",1,"myRect",1)
LINE(50,50,150,150,"#000000",1,"myLine",1)
V_SEPARATOR(300,2,"#000000",1,"vSep1",1)
H_SEPARATOR(200,2,"#000000",1,"hSep1",1)
```

### **Browser Compatibility**
- Modern browsers with HTML5 Canvas support
